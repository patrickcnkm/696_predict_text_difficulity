# 696_predict_text_difficulity
#### Predict text difficulty in SIADS 696
The project aims to predict the text difficulty based on the data provided by project guideline. The project is consisted of 4 parts:
- Dataset: 01_data
- Unsupervised learning to explore the features or predict text diffculity: 02_Text_Clustering.ipynb
- Supervised lerarning to predict text diffuclity in 2 approaches: 
  - tf-idf + logstic regression: 03_Text classification with BERT in PyTorch.ipynb
  - Bert based embedding + classification:
- zero shot / few shots to supplement supervised learning to improve the performance.
